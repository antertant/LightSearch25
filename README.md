# LightSearch25
A light BM25-based full-text search engine written in Java.

# **Introduction**
This project contains both indexer and search engine, and the search engine algorithm is BM25. 
To make the engine work correctly, your data needs to follow the format of <sample.xml>, otherwise, you need to modify the engine to fit your own data format.

# **Build & Run Instructions**

This section gives instructions for building and running the programs on Linux.

## **BUILD** 
*These programs require ***JDK***, ***Java*** and ***MakeFile*** to compile and execute. Here I assume that you have installed and configured them correctly.*

All source codes for this project are put in the **src** folder. To build this engine, you have two options:

1. Switch your terminal path to the root of the repository, then using **MakeFile** to automatically build the program:

```
$ make
```

2. Or running commands below to build the program:

```
$ javac -d out ./src/Search/*.java
$ javac -d out ./src/IndexEngine/*.java
```

After build completion, you will see an **out** folder in root of the repository. The compiled class files are stored in it.

## **RUN** 
To run the program, you should put all your data into one single file, let us assume it is **data.dat**.

First, execute the indexer engine to retrieve each single article and the corresponding meta data from **data.dat**:

```
$ java -classpath out IndexEngine.IndexEngine <data_path> <storage_path>
```

Where **<data_path>** is the path of **data.dat**, **<storage_path>** is the path to store the meta data.

Then, you can run the commands below in the root of the repository to execute the search engine:

```
$ java -classpath out Search.Run <metaData_path>
```

Where **<metaData_path>** is the path of meta data folder generated by IndexEngine.

You should enter your query after seeing the "Enter your query:" in the terminal, and the system will display the 
top-10 results of your query. To see the full document, type the corresponding rank number and push "Enter". To 
start a new query, type "N". To quit the system, type "Q".

# **Running Demo**
Below is a demo to use this engine to index TREC latimes data and query articles in it.
